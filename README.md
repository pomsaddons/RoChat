# BloxCord

A lightweight chat stack that creates one SignalR channel per Roblox jobId.

(this is actually renamed to rochat now so you can say it in the normal roblox chat this documentation IS WAYYY out of date the entire backend is in TS now)
## Projects

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BloxCord.Api` | ASP.NET Core (net8.0) backend with `/api/channels` REST endpoints and `/hubs/chat` SignalR hub. Keeps in-memory channel/participant state indexed by jobId. |
| `BloxCord.Client` | WPF (net9.0-windows) desktop client. Reads `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\logs` to grab jobId + userId the same way as `Bloxstrap/Integrations/ActivityWatcher.cs`, resolves the username via `https://users.roblox.com/v1/users/{id}` (as seen in `Bloxstrap/Models/Entities/UserDetails.cs`), fetches avatar headshots from the Roblox thumbnails API, and connects to the backend via SignalR. |

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 9.0.300 (ships with .NET 8 target packs and WPF tooling)
- Roblox installed locally so `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Roblox/logs` exists when parsing sessions

## Build & Run

```powershell
# Restore + build everything
 dotnet build BloxCord.sln

# Start the chat backend on http://localhost:5158
 dotnet run --project BloxCord.Api

# In a new terminal, launch the WPF client
 dotnet run --project BloxCord.Client
```

## Using the app

1. Launch a Roblox experience so that a fresh `Player` log is produced.
2. In the WPF app, click **Load Roblox Session**. The app reuses Bloxstrap's regex patterns to find the latest `! Joining game ...` entry for the jobId and the `universeid:...userid:...` entry for the userId, then calls the Roblox Users API to obtain your username.
3. Review/edit the backend URL (defaults to `http://localhost:5158`), username, or jobId if needed.
4. Click **Connect** to create/join the jobId channel. Every participant in the same jobId shares the stream; **Send** broadcasts to everyone connected to that channel.
5. Use **Disconnect** to leave the SignalR group.

## Implementation notes

- Channel state lives in-memory via `ChannelRegistry`; history is capped at 200 messages.
- Each SignalR connection calls `JoinChannel`, which mirrors the REST call to `/api/channels`. The hub emits `ChannelSnapshot`, `ParticipantsChanged`, and `ReceiveMessage` events.
- Typing notifications flow through the new `NotifyTyping` hub method and `TypingIndicator` broadcast. The client shows "typing..." hints inline plus badges on the participant list.
- The client relies on `RobloxLogParser.TryReadLatestAsync` and `RobloxUserDirectory.TryGetUsernameAsync` to reproduce the same jobId/username discovery approach that Bloxstrap already uses, and `RobloxAvatarDirectory.TryGetHeadshotUrlAsync` to keep the rounded dark UI stocked with Roblox profile pictures.
- Swagger UI is available at `http://localhost:5158/swagger` for quick testing.
